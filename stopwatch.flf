Font Author: Mihail Ivanchev
License: MIT License
This font was created specifically for sw in order to display the stopwatch
in a more visually appealing "digital" look compared to the default terminal
font. It contains only digits and the characters ":.,". I was inspired by
the figfont "ANSI Regular" but wanted something smaller. The font uses
full block, upper half block and lower half block characters only.
Because of this there is no real baseline but the middle of the 3rd row is
thought of as baseline.
